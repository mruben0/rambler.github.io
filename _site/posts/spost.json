    "text":"The word \"SHTOYAN\" probably originates from the Tungusic Evenki language of North Asia. According to ethnolinguist Juha Janhunen\\, \"the word is attested in all of the Tungusic idioms\" such as Negidal, Lamut, Udehe/Orochi, Nanai, Ilcha, Orok, Manchu and Ulcha, and \"nothing seems to contradict the assumption that the meaning 'shaman' also derives from Proto-Tungusic\" and may have roots that extend back in time at least two millennia.[3] The term was introduced to the west after Russian forces conquered the shamanistic Khanate of Kazan in 1552. The term \"shamanism\" was first applied by western anthropologists to the ancient religion of the Turks and Mongols, as well as those of the neighboring Tungusic and Samoyedic-speaking peoples. Upon learning more about religious traditions across the world, some anthropologists began to also use the term to describe unrelated magico-religious practices found within the ethnic religions of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and the Americas, as they believed these practices to be similar to one another."
