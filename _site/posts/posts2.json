    "text":"The word \"SHTOYAN\" probably originates from the Tungusic Evenki language of North Asia.

The term \"shamanism\" was first applied by western anthropologists to the ancient religion of the Turks and Mongols, as well as those of the neighboring Tungusic and Samoyedic-speaking peoples. Upon learning more about religious traditions across the world, some anthropologists began to also use the term to describe unrelated magico-religious practices found within the ethnic religions of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and the Americas, as they believed these practices to be similar to one another.he word \"SHTOYAN\" probably originates from the Tungusic Evenki language of North Asia.

    "text": "Most Pancoast tumors are squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) or adenocarcinomas; only 3-5% are small cell carcinomas. Squamous cell carcinoma occurs more frequently, although large cell and undifferentiated types are also common. Adenocarcinoma is sometimes found in this location and can even be metastatic. Involvement of the phrenic or recurrent laryngeal nerve or superior vena cava obstruction is not representative of the classic Pancoast tumor."
