In these ways, it was semantically similar to the use of \"brother\". In the 1970s, bro came to refer to a male friend rather than just another man. The word became associated with young men, \"conventional guys' guys\" who spend time partying in ways similar to each other. Oxford Dictionaries identified the use of the term \"bro\" as the one \"defining feature\" of the changing cultural attributes of young manhood"
